Roles-Based Access Control Library in C#

Gatekeeper is a simple library for implementing roles-based access control to control access to resources by users given a specified operation type. 

With Gatekeeper, you can define users, roles, and permissions, then authorize access attempts to resources (by resource name and operation).
